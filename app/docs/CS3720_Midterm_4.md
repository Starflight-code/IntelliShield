I asked chat gpt how to implement a reusable toggle button component in React Native?

![](./button.png)



This component allowed me  to create a reusable toggle button that can be customized with different text labels and button states. Instead of writing the same toggle logic multiple times in the Settings screen, I created this single component that handles all toggle functionality.


I asked chat gpt how to implement a hold-to-activate button with progress bar in React Native?

![](./start.png)



This code helped us implement the crucial hold-to-activate functionality for the panic button, preventing accidental emergency alerts. The solution uses both a visual progress bar (updated every 100ms) and a 5-second timeout, giving users clear feedback that they need to hold the button.
